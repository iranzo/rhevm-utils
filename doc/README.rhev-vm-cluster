rhev-vm-cluster:
	Description:

Script for elastic management (EMS) of RHEV-H/RHEL vm's for RHEVM which
tries to place VM's with the tag cluster_ (to identify them as RHCS members)
into separate phyisical hosts to avoid single point of failure

	Goals:
		- Do not manage any vm without tag elas_manage
		- Process RHCS as a grouping of VM's with cluster_**** tag
		- Live migrate VM's with cluster_**** tag if more than one
		is at the same physical host

	tags behaviour:
		- elas_manage: manage this vm by this script
		- elas_start : autostart this vm if it's down
		- cluster_***: identify this vm as a member of RHCS ***
