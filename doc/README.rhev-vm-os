rhev-vm-os:
	Description:

Script for elastic management (EMS) of RHEV-H/RHEL vm's for RHEVM which
tries to place VM's with the same O.S. together at same hosts to maximize changes for KSM to save resources

	Goals:
		- Do not manage any vm without tag elas_manage
		- Live migrate VM's with higher O.S. usage count to first host and migrate away the others
		- keep repeating cycle until no more ram at host or no more vm's

	tags behaviour:
		- elas_manage: manage this vm by this script
